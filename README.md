# Manual-Testing
 Manual testing is a vital quality assurance process where testers execute test cases without the use of automated tools. It involves human interaction with the software to identify defects, verify functionality, and ensure overall system reliability. Testers follow predefined test scenarios, meticulously documenting test results, and providing valuable insights into user experience. Manual testing is particularly effective in scenarios requiring exploratory testing, usability assessments, and validating intricate functionalities. Its adaptive nature allows for thorough examination of software elements, contributing to a comprehensive quality assurance strategy.
